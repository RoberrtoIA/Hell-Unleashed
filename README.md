# Hell Unleashed - Doom 3 Mod

**Hell Unleashed** is a horror and survival mod for Doom 3 that intensifies the original gameplay experience, aligning more closely with the survival intent rather than the fast-paced action of the first two games. It plunges the **marine** into a much darker and more terrifying atmosphere. This mod is designed to work with the **Dhewm 3** *source port* and uses the **Redux** layer as an interface selector. The mod is intended to function with the original 2004 release version, not the 2012 re-release, the BFG Edition. This is because the original Doom 3 was the last ID Software game to have its source code made open, allowing it to run with the community's **Dhewm 3** *source port* for modding. In contrast, the BFG Edition is not designed to be open-source.

### Key Features

-   **Intensified Atmosphere:** This mod transforms Doom 3 into a more extreme horror experience, with weapons, combat system, and enemies rebalanced for a more suffocating gameplay.
    
-   **Dhewm 3 Compatibility:** **Hell Unleashed** has been developed to be played with the Dhewm 3 *source port*, allowing external mods to be run simultaneously.
    
-   **Redux:** The Redux layer provides updated effects and textures to current standards, offering better visuals and a 16:9 aspect ratio (the original game ran in a 4:3 aspect). The mod runs by selecting Redux from the start screen. While itâ€™s possible to run it directly with Dhewm 3, you would lose the features provided by the Redux layer.


## System Requirements

-   **Operating System:** Windows XP, Vista, 8, 8.1 without Redux. Windows 10 and 11 with Redux.
-   **Doom 3:** Version 1.3 or higher [Doom 3 Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/208200/DOOM_3/)
-   **Dhewm 3:** Version 1.5.1 or higher [https://dhewm3.org](#)
-   **Redux:** [https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-3-redux](#)


## Installation

### 1. Install Dhewm 3

2.  Extract the files to a folder of your choice.
3.  Copy the Doom 3 files from the `base` folder (i.e., the `pak000.pk4` to `pak008.pk4` files) into the `base` directory of **Dhewm 3**.
4.  Extract the patch file into the `base` folder of **Dhewm 3**.
5.  If you want Steam to track your playtime and unlock achievements, perform this process in the Doom 3 installation directory on Steam.

3.  For a more detailed guide, you can watch the following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSu2x41rHTQ&t=192s.


### 3. Install Hell Unleashed

1.  Download the **Hell Unleashed** mod from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SW7ppMkqu_keK48sNbnJqUiVwNlcCPJ6?usp=sharing) link (the files are too large to host on a file repository like GitHub).
2.  Extract the content into the folder within the **Dhewm 3** directory.
3.  Launch **Dhewm 3** and select **Redux** from the mod selection menu.
4. In the `optional` folder, you can place the `zzzzzz_double_barrel_shotgun.pk4` file into the `base` folder of **Dhewm 3** to access the double-barrel shotgun in the `admin`, `delta4`, `delta5`, and `hell1` levels. It is still in a very early development stage. It includes an older version of the HUD that is not in HD and only allows weapon selection via the mouse wheel. Additionally, it may have some ammunition counting issues when reaching 0 if there is still ammo in the standard shotgun's magazine.


## Detailed Features

### Enemies

Enemies have been rebalanced for a survival experience. The `shake` effect when being attacked has been removed, and damage has been increased for better combat readability. The `imp` demon now has a double attack. Overall, enemies deal more damage but are defeated more quickly.

### Weapons and Equipment

Rebalanced damage, ammunition, magazines, and aesthetics of the weapons. Left-click now allows aiming, while normally shooting will be from the hip. When shooting from the hip, there will be dispersion, whereas aiming reduces it to almost 0. Exploration in the environments is now encouraged more. All weapons have new sounds.

1.  **Pistol:** Now uses 7 bullets per magazine, with a total inventory of 28 bullets, plus those in the weapon, totaling 35 bullets. Damage has been significantly increased but with much less ammunition. It now behaves like a magnum. Small ammo provides 3 bullets, and large ammo provides 5 bullets.

2.  **Shotgun:** Now uses 5 shells per magazine, with a total inventory of 25 shells, plus those in the weapon, totaling 30. It is now a truly functional shotgun at short and medium ranges, with damage increased by 1.9x and dispersion reduced by 80%. Ammo is now much scarcer to compensate for its massive effectiveness. Small ammo provides 1 shell, and large ammo provides 3 shells.

3.  **Machine Gun:** 30 bullets per magazine, with small ammo providing 15 bullets and large ammo providing 20 bullets. Damage increased by 1.25x.
